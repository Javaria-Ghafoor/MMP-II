# MMP-II
Computational Physics repository for MMP II course

The main aim of maintaining this repository is to help my colleagues in fast learning programming for this course.  
  
The codes I've uploaded have been well commented and the output of the programs can only be fully understood if you go through the code, moreover try to recode. Some terminologies/concepts have been left for the person analysing the code to figure out on self. Happy coding in python friends :D.

Do visit the Python Documentations regarding different libraries and funtions. They explain great. It is assumed that you've already taken an Intro to Programming course. The Numerical Accuracy Folder is designed to
- make you comfortable with Python syntax (if you've never coded in Python before)
- to intrigue you to seek for the answer towards what's happening in the "ThingsToWatchOutFor.py" script :P

note: all codes in this repository are in python 3.7
