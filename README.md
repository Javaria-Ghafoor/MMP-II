# MMP-II
Computational Physics repository for MMP II course

The main aim of maintaining this repository is to help my colleagues in fast learning programming for this course.  
  
The codes I've uploaded have been well commented and the output of the programs can only be fully understood if you go through the code, moreover try to recode. Some terminologies/concepts have been left for the person analysing the code to figure out on self. Happy coding in python friends :D.
